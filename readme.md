SQL Parser
================

| **status** | alpha |
|------------|-------|

A utility to parse column and table relations referenced out of a SQL statement.

Highly influenced by https://github.com/macbre/sql-metadata, but designed for more analytics-y queries with lots of CTEs, subqueries, window functions, and other complexity.
